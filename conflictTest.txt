<<<<<<< HEAD

Line #1 - This is a conflict, really bad code with typos

In the middle we have tones of code! so much of it!
We have nested functions, enough loops to make you sick,
parallel processing, defining models with 45 parameters or more 
and all writting in a launguige you never coded in before. 
0% chance you will read through this code. 

Line #2 - change me!

And the nightmareish code continues...
seriously, at this point you start wondering if can sue whoever wrote 
This for emotional damage.
